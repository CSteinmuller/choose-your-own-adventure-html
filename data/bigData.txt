        You enter a dark room.

    <scene>
        An unfortunate tinge of must hits your nostrils and you descend the weathered staircase
        into the dimly lit recess. As you enter the room, your initial examination yields a few
        major landmarks. To your immediate right, a bar with only one patron and an admittedly
        disinterested barkeep. To your left, in the far back, a small, home made stage of sorts
        stocked only with a medium sized stack of speakers and a lone guitar. Filling the void
        between, sporadic tables and chairs with few bodies within them.

        You stand at the entrance, looking out of place. Better do something before you catch
        the eye of any rogue local.
