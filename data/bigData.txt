        You enter a dark room.
    </title>
    <scene>
        An unfortunate tinge of must hits your nostrils and you descend the weathered staircase
        into the dimly lit recess. As you enter the room, your initial examination yields a few
        major landmarks. To your immediate right, a bar with only one patron and an admittedly
        disinterested barkeep. To your left, in the far back, a small, home made stage of sorts
        stocked only with a medium sized stack of speakers and a lone guitar. Filling the void
        between, sporadic tables and chairs with few bodies within them.

        You stand at the entrance, looking out of place. Better do something before you catch
        the eye of any rogue local.

        You examine the stage.
    </title>
    <scene>
        A medium sized stack of speakers are connected to a rats nest of tangled threadbare cables. 
        Leaned against them is a crimson electric guitar that's seen better days. The stage is wooden, the boards 
        stained with decades of spilled beer and other liquids of dubious origin.

        You ascend the stairs.

    <scene>
        Uncertain and fearful of the new environment, you immediately turn around and begin to retreat,
        as is your standard. In your haste, you fumble midway through your climb and tumble back downwards.
        As you regain consciousness, you find yourself sat at one of the tables you had noticed littering
        the room. Nobody seems to care regarding your buffoonery.

        You proselytize.

    <scene>
        You speak with passion and energy, regaling the audience with engaging anecdotes and
        carefully articulated assessments. Two hours later, you conclude the lecture with stunned
        silence from your viewers. Unfortunately, you forgot that you are an idiot and nothing
        you had said made any sense. Luckily, nobody seems to care.
