        You enter a dark room.
    </title>
    <scene>
        An unfortunate tinge of must hits your nostrils and you descend the weathered staircase
        into the dimly lit recess. As you enter the room, your initial examination yields a few
        major landmarks. To your immediate right, a bar with only one patron and an admittedly
        disinterested barkeep. To your left, in the far back, a small, home made stage of sorts
        stocked only with a medium sized stack of speakers and a lone guitar. Filling the void
        between, sporadic tables and chairs with few bodies within them. 
    </scene>

        You stand at the entrance, looking out of place. Better do something before you catch
        the eye of any rogue local.

    <scene>
        A medium sized stack of speakers are connected to a rats nest of tangled threadbare cables. 
        Leaned against them is a crimson electric guitar that's seen better days. The stage is wooden, the boards 
        stained with decades of spilled beer and other liquids of dubious origin.

    <scene>
        Uncertain and fearful of the new environment, you immediately turn around and begin to retreat,
        as is your standard. In your haste, you fumble midway through your climb and tumble back downwards.
        As you regain consciousness, you find yourself sat at one of the tables you had noticed littering
        the room. Nobody seems to care regarding your buffoonery.

        You speak with passion and energy, regaling the audience with engaging anecdotes and
        carefully articulated assessments. Two hours later, you conclude the lecture with stunned

        you had said made any sense. Luckily, nobody seems to care.

        You attempt to rise from your seat.
    </title>
    <scene>
        Overwhelming attraction to maintain seated envelops your being. You quickly rationalize
        that this is a psychic force pushing you into the chair. You look to the ceiling as you
        fight with all your mental might and prowess to overcome the mysterious binding.
        
        After a good forty five minutes, you slump, defeated and in anguish. You attempt to place
        your head in your hands but forget that your hands are bound. You examine your arms only 
        to find that they have been secured to the armrests with metal chains, as are your feet
        to the legs of the chair. Perhaps you should have dealt with that first.

        You power up.

    <scene>
        You decide to channel all of your inner energy into powering up. You close your eyes
        and concentrate, feeling the raw power build up within you. Soon, there is a tingling
        spread through your limbs. You utter a shallow yell. As your spirit builds, you scream
        louder and louder. Soon, you are bellowing at the top of your lungs. You feel as though
        you can crush the world in your hands. You are the most powerful man in the universe.
        It soon occurs to you that you have been doing nothing but yelling for roughly an hour
        and had done nothing about your situation.
